function [Yn,Yb]=ay_sampling(DISTR,Cut_Time,Uk,In,Ib,Param,XPos0,SPos0)

%% Input Argument
    % DISTR, a vecotr of two variables. The [1 0] means there is only normal
    % observation/s, [0 1] means there is only binary observation/s, and [1 1]
    % will be both observations.
    % Uk: is a matrix of size KxS1 - K is the length of observation - input to
    % State model - X(k)=A*X(k-1)+B*Uk+Wk
    % In: is a matrix of size KxS3 - K is the length of observation - input to Normal observation model
    % Yn(k)=(C.*MCk)*X(k)+(D.*MDk)*In+Vk       - C and D are free parameters,
    % and MCk and MDk are input dependent components
    % Ib: is a matrix of size KxS5 - K is the length of observation - input to Binary observation model
    %  P(Yb(k)==1)=sigmoid((E.*MEk)*X(k)+(F.*MFk)*Ib       - E and F are free parameters,
    % and MEk and MFk are input dependent components
    % Yn: is a matrix of size KxN  - K is the length of observation, matrix of
    % normal observation
    % Yb: is a matrix of size KxN  - K is the length of observation, matrix of
    % binary observation
    % Param: it keeps the model information, and paramaters
