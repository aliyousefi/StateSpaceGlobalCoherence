function [Rs,P]=ay_x_2_rp(DISTR,XP,Param,In,Ib)

%% Input Argument
    % MODE : leraning mode, defines how the learning value is updated
    %       MODE ==1, it means that the learning curve is determiend by X
    %       MODE ==2, it means that the learning curve is determiend by RT
    %       MODE ==3, it means that the learning curve is determiend by P - probability of true answer
    % Range: A vector definign upper and lower band values for the learning
    %       If it is based on X, it should be 2xlength(X), where the first row is the upper bound and the second is lowe bound (optional)
    %       If it is based on RT/P, it is a vector of 2x1, or scalar. Th first value defines the upper bound and the second is lowe band 
    % XP - Mean of the Estimate
    % SP - Covariance of the Estimate
    % Param, In, Ib - Check any other function
    
%% Output Argument
    % LRange: It is the learning rate either a vector of 2x1 or 1x1
    % The upper bound means what is the probability of being above upper bound
    % The lwer bound means what is the probability of being below lower bound
